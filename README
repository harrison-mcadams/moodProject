As part of a New Year's resolution, we decided to start a project chronicling our mood. The idea was to flex our data analysis skills on a personal project together, with bonus points for making it automated and open-source.

In this repository, we hope to eventually have:
1) Set-up instructions for how we configured the data collection process
2) Analysis code to make sense of the data
3) What we've learned
